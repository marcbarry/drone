Video Source
============
raspivid -o - -w 640 -h 360 -t 0 -fps 20 -vf -hf | nc -k -l 2222
	outputs H264-ES (Elementary Stream)
		Split up into NAL units, separated by startcode prefix
		There is no length information in it because it is a bitstream. You have to look for startcode pattern (0x000001 OR 0x00000001) in the bitstream for the next NAL unit.

Video Receiver
==============
